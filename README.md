  Using data from MenuStat, which contains nutritional info of dishes from large chain restaurants, I created an interactive dashboard using PowerBI that provides nutritional details of dishes served in restaurants and allows users to filter based on dietary preferences. Using 10 parameters that affects diets the most(Calories, Carbohydrates, Total Fat, Saturated Fat, Trans Fat, Sugar, Sodium, Protein, Cholesterol, and Dietary Fiber), I created filters in PowerBI to display dishes from restaurants that can accommodate the requirements of strict diets. In this way, athletes and children alike can make use of this dashboard to find nutritional data of dishes served at various restaurant chains, providing a solution to the issue of not finding dishes in restaurants that suit dietary preferences.
